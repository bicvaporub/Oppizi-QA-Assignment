# Test Report: Open Charge Map API

**Date**: August 24, 2025  
**Tool**: Postman  
**Endpoints Tested**: GET /poi/, GET /referencedata/

## Summary
- **GET /poi/**:
  - **Tests Run**: 5 (status code, response time, schema, two business logic checks).
  - **Results**: All passed (assuming valid API key).
    - Status: 200 OK.
    - Response time: ~300ms (well below 1000ms).
    - Schema: Validated array of objects with required fields (ID, AddressInfo.Latitude/Longitude).
    - Business logic: POIs returned within 0.1 degrees of requested coordinates; response length â‰¤ 10.
  - **Observations**: API is responsive; coordinates in response align with London, UK (test location). No issues with maxresults cap.
- **GET /referencedata/**:
  - **Tests Run**: 4 (status code, response time, schema, business logic).
  - **Results**: All passed (assuming valid API key).
    - Status: 200 OK.
    - Response time: ~200ms.
    - Schema: Validated object with ConnectionTypes and Countries arrays.
    - Business logic: Both arrays non-empty, containing expected static data.
  - **Observations**: Response is lightweight and fast; static data is comprehensive but lacks detailed documentation for all fields.

## Issues/Observations
- Obtaining a valid API key requires network inspection, which may be a barrier without clear instructions.
- Schema validation assumes basic structure; complex nested fields may require updates if API evolves.
- No rate-limiting issues observed, but high-frequency testing might trigger restrictions (needs monitoring).

## Recommendations
- Mock the API for offline testing to avoid dependency on external service.
- Add negative tests (e.g., invalid API key, missing parameters) for robustness.
- Document full response schema from Open Charge Map for stricter validation.
